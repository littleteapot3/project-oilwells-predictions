# Project - Oil Well Profit Predictor

## Project Overview
This project aims to identify the most profitable region for establishing a new oil well for the OilyGiant mining company. Using geological data from three different regions, the analysis applies predictive modeling and statistical methods to guide investment decisions and minimize financial risk.

## Objectives
- **Explore and preprocess the data**: Understand the structure and quality of the dataset.
- **Develop a predictive model**: Estimate the volume of oil reserves for potential wells.
- **Select the most profitable wells**: Focus on wells with the highest expected returns.
- **Estimate profit and risks**: Use statistical techniques to evaluate investment feasibility.

## Dataset
The dataset contains the following columns:

| Column     | Description                                                                 |
|------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `id`       | Unique oil well identifier.                                                |
| `f0, f1, f2` | Features representing geological data points. |
| `product`  | Volume of reserves in the oil well (in thousand barrels).                  |

## Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Load and inspect the data.
   - Handle missing values and data inconsistencies.
   - Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand feature distributions.

2. **Model Training**
   - Split data into training and testing sets.
   - Train a Linear Regression model to predict oil reserve volumes.
   - Evaluate model performance using RMSE and R².

3. **Profitability Analysis**
   - Select the top wells based on predictions.
   - Estimate profits for each region.
   - Apply statistical techniques (e.g., bootstrapping) to assess risk.

## Key Results
- The best-performing region for oil extraction was determined based on predicted profitability.
- The model's predictive accuracy was evaluated using RMSE and R².
- Statistical analysis helped estimate risk and expected returns.

## Libraries Used
This project leverages Python's data science ecosystem, including:
- **Pandas & NumPy** for data manipulation
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** for visualization
- **Scikit-learn** for machine learning
- **SciPy** for statistical analysis

### Running the Analysis
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python installed along with the required libraries:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn scipy
```
1. Open the `oil_well_analysis.ipynb` file and execute the cells step by step.

## Potential Improvements
- **Feature Engineering**: Extract additional insights from geological data.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimize the Linear Regression model.
- **Alternative Models**: Experiment with Decision Trees or Random Forests.
- **Time Series Analysis**: Investigate how reserve estimates change over time.
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Use Streamlit or Plotly Dash to visualize results interactively.
